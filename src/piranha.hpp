/** \file piranha.hpp
 * \brief Global piranha header file.
 * 
 * Include this file to import piranha's entire public interface.
 */

/// Root piranha namespace.
/**
 * \todo switch to auto -> decltype declarations of member functions for complicated types (e.g., tuples) when decltype on this
 * becomes available.
 * \todo explain in general section the base assumptions of move semantics and thread safety (e.g., require implicitly that
 * all moved-from objects are assignable and destructable, and everything not thread-safe by default).
 * \todo base_series test: missing merge terms with negative+move (that actually swaps the contents of the series) and negative+move with different series types.
 * \todo check wherever use use std::vector as class member that we implement copy assignment with copy+move. There is no guarantee that copy operator=() on vector
 * (or standard containers) has strong exception safety guarantee.
 * \todo check usage of max_load_factor (especially wrt flukes in * instead of / or viceversa).
 * \todo review use of numeric_cast: in some places we might be using it in such a way we expect errors if converting floating point to int, but this is not the case (from the doc)
 * \todo the tuning parameters should be tested and justified (e.g., when to go into mt mode, etc.).
 * \todo probably we should make overflow-safe all operations on keys that currently are not: multiplication, computation of degree (including in truncators), etc.
 * and then optimize instead in the multipliers (by checking the ranges before performing the multiplication) -> this probably becomes null in case the caching of degree
 * values in the truncators turns out to work ok.
 * \todo think of new way of interoperate between composite types (e.g., complex and series) vs non-composite types. I.e., allow complex<T> + U
 * only if T + U produces T. When going down that route, use and expand the existing arithmetic type traits (is_addable, etc.). Probably it is a good idea
 * in this piece of work to start reworking the generic series constructors, possibly dropping the converting constructors for keys, and move from there.
 * In general it seems possibly useful to remove interaction with different keys from interoperable operators (but keep it for constructors?).
 * Connected to this, we should specify better the semantics of math operations: a +-*= b means exactly a = a +-* b (use optimising behaviour like
 * implementing in-place add separately only when it is really equivalent), and specify this well in the documentation
 * of series multiplier, term's multiply methods, etc. (they should make clear that the return type deduction and operand orders was already determined for them).
 * \todo series multadd to speed-up series multiplication when coefficients are series?
 * \todo start experimenting with parallel sort in multipliers and truncators (e.g., for the rectangular benchmark).
 * \todo forbid interoperability in +-* between series with different keys?
 * \todo interface to query degree should be the same across power series and truncator: should add missing overload in power series to query partial degree of a single symbol,
 * and maybe replace in the high level interface the std::set of string with initializer list, as it seems sometimes {"a","b"} is not picked up as std::set of string.
 * \todo look into perfect forwarding of members, for use in series, hash set (?) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8570655/perfect-forwarding-a-member-of-object
 * \todo look into forwarding and delegating constructors when they become available.
 * \todo understand the consequences of not compiling boost libs we link to in c++0x mode. Stuff like this could happen:
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10498887/bug-in-libstdc-regarding-stdlist-assignment -> compile boost in c++11/c++0x mode in gentoo and windows.
 * \todo it seems like default construction of c++ containers might throw :/ We should probably double-check we do not assume any nothrow behaviour in
 * such cases. For instance, if we use an old-style C allocation function and we need to create a container _before_ calling free(), then the behaviour
 * might not be exception-safe.
 * \todo think about the generic binary term constrcutor, especially in conjunction with the generic series interop. Do we want to leave it generic
 * or force it to be strictly from (cf_type,key_type)? In the latter case, we should review its usage.
 * \todo in pyranha, access to static variables should be made thread-safe (first of all in the Python sense,
 * e.g., importing the module from multiple Python threads). In particular, access to the coefficient list (construct on first
 * use with mutex protection instead of at register time? or maybe avoid using static variable and build each time)
 * and python converters (protect the inited flags with mutexes).
 * \todo instead of disabling debug checks at shutdown for series, maybe we should do like in Python and register an
 * atexit() function to clean up custom derivatives before static destruction starts. We could register the atexit
 * at the first invocation of register_custom_derivative() for each series type, set a flag and then query the flag each time.
 * Probably the existing mutex can be resued as well. Probably it makes sense to keep both, as the existing method would
 * work in a more generic fashion.
 * \todo pyranha: enable math for numpy's floating point type, and arrays. Also, think about enabling conversion from the numpy float
 * in the from-python converters?
 * \todo: pyranha tests should test the *exposition* and/or wrapping, not the functionality of the library. For poly/poisson series, add
 * tests for degree/order, plus add in math.py the degree/order methods in order to mirror math.hpp.
 * \todo in the rework of the substitution methods with toolboxes, remember to switch the interface of the key's subs to use string
 * instead of symbol for consistency.
 * \todo initializer_list ctors: should they be explicit or not?
 * \todo binomial coefficient: for double/real types it should really be implemented in terms of gamma functions:
 * http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/math/doc/sf_and_dist/html/math_toolkit/special/factorials/sf_binomial.html
 * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GammaFunction.html
 * http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html (implement in terms of gamma functions as indicated by the Wolfram link)
 * \todo review usage of new, we probably want to switch to unqualified new() in order to account for possible overloads
 * to be found via ADL -> note that placement new cannot be overloaded:
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3675059/how-could-i-sensibly-overload-placement-operator-new (and 18.6.1.3 in the standard)
 * so we might as well keep ::new in those cases.
 * \todo similarly, review all struct/class is_/has_is_ type traits to prevent ADL by using piranha specifiers as needed.
 * \todo should we always use piranha when calling functions in order to prevent ADL? -> note that these ADL concerns apply
 * only to unqualified function calls, of which there are not many (e.g., the math type traits are all defined outside piranha::math
 * and hence always include the math:: qualifier).
 * \todo consider replacing uses of iterator facade with inheritance from std::iterator.
 * \todo drop noexcept(true) on constructors once we move to gcc 4.8: http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56191.
 * \todo think through once and for all the DLL vs static lib thing, with adequate macro support for visibility/dllexport/import etc.
 * \todo after the switch to 4.8, we can drop in many places the forward ctor macro in favour of just inheriting constructors (in other
 * places, e.g., polynomial, we still need them as we are adding new custom ctors). Probably the assignment macro must stay anyway.
 * \todo consider replacing the & operator with std::addressof in positional new forms. It seems there might be a perf. penalty
 * involved in doing that, if that is the case we can either do it only if the type is not POD or maybe even if it does not have
 * the operator overloaded (via decltype SFINAE).
 * \todo in pyranha, we should be able to provide self-descriptivie docstrings for the exposed series, based on the
 * template enable_if mechanism.
 * \todo consider bringing back the unroller from the vectorization work into the small_vector class.
 * \todo some versions of mingw want __mingw_aligned_malloc instead of _aligned_malloc, fix this with a check in the build system. Or
 * maybe check whether __mingw_aligned_malloc is available in all mingw versions.
 * \todo pyranha: try to understand what is the best way to have functions which are extensible from the user. E.g., we have math.cos
 * that works on series, mpmath, etc., how can we provide a mechanism for a user to add her own specialisations?
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18957424/proper-way-to-make-functions-extensible-by-the-user
 * \todo check usages of std algorithms against the assumptions on the functors used:
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20119810/parallel-implementations-of-std-algorithms-and-side-effects
 * \todo probably better to remove the thread_management class and use free functions directly for the binding.
 * \todo review the usage of the static keyword for functions: we are header-only now, it's probably not needed (esp. static inline).
 * \todo review all usages of lexical_cast and stringstreams, probably we need either to replace them altogether or at least to make
 * sure they behave consistently wrt locale settings.
 * \todo review the usage of std::set of strings/symbols for the partial degree/order methods. Need to uniform this once and for all
 * with a good rationale.
 * \todo doxygen: check usage of param[(in,)out], and consider using the \tparam command.
